Enumerations of kMOLS using vectors

Notes: Conjugates not working yet

c8		Small changes in memory allocation and genPossPermlist
c7		Join permutations and compare
c5	6659c5c Make fewer copies on permute, standardform, rollup etc
c4	dd152f2 getShuffles changed to use global list possiblePerms instead of recalcul
c3	f98fc9f Integrated permuteSymbols and permuteMOLS, +-6%
c2	8f1c92e Changed permuteMOLS to use indices
c1	1864872 Vector enumeration working beautifully
